<h1>Focus on Today</h1>
"Focus on Today" is a simple goal-setting app where users can add up to 4 goals for the day. 
The app encourages focus by not allowing users to mark any goals as complete until all 4 goals have been added. 
Once all goals are added, users can mark them as complete one by one. The app also displays the current day and date on the page.
